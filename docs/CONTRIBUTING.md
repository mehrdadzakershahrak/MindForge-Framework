# Contributing to MindForge

We welcome contributions that align with our project's principles and mission. Here's how you can contribute.

## Be Scrappy

- Experiment, try new things, and share your results.
- Use personal sandboxes for experiments.
- Submit pull requests with a summary of findings.

## Avoid Vendor Lockin

- Contributions should be compatible with multiple AI providers.
- Preference for open-source solutions.

## Task-Constrained Approach

- Contributions should be accompanied by empirical data.
- Features should be testable and focused on the framework's capabilities.

## Avoiding Overcomplication

- Aim for simplicity and clarity.
- Small, incremental steps are valued over large, complex changes.

## Establish New Principles

- Be open to redefining software paradigms.
- Contributions should potentially introduce new principles of autonomous software design.
