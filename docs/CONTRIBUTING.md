## Contribution Guidelines
### Scope of Contributions
We encourage contributions that:

Embrace Scrappiness: We value initiative and experimentation. If you have an idea that you believe will benefit the project, don't hesitate to try it out. Use your own environments to test your ideas, and share your findings with the community. If your experiments prove successful, they may be integrated into the main branch through a pull request.

Promote Diversity in Dependencies: While we strive to be model agnostic, it's crucial that we avoid vendor lock-in, especially single-source dependencies. Contributions should preferably be compatible with open-source models and allow for interoperability among different AI providers and technologies.

Adhere to Task-Constrained Development: Understand that our framework's capabilities are determined by the tasks it can perform. Your contributions should align with our current task space and capabilities. All new features should be accompanied by tests that provide empirical data to support their effectiveness.

Simplify, Don't Overcomplicate: Aim for simplicity in your contributions. Set modest goals and make incremental improvements. Our vision is grand, but we achieve it one step at a time. Contributions that add unnecessary complexity without clear benefits will be critically reviewed.

Forge New Principles: As we navigate new territories in software architecture, be open to challenging and redefining established paradigms. We encourage contributions that explore new principles of autonomous software design.
