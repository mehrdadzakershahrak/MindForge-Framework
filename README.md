# MindForge

Welcome to MindForge, an open-source initiative aimed at emulating structured human cognition through software. Our goal is to create a framework capable of evolving and addressing complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable sub-tasks, handled by specialized AI agents.

## Vision

MindForge is designed to be a multi-layered, autonomous cognitive entity that operates on local hardware, prioritizing privacy and control. It leverages publicly available AI models for cognitive tasks, structured across six distinct cognitive layers, aiming to replicate the complexity of human thought.

## Principles

- **Autonomous Objectives**: Self-directing, self-correcting, and self-improving AI agents.
- **Open Source Collaboration**: Inspired by community-driven projects and collaborative efforts.
- **Task-Constrained Approach**: Empirical and objective-oriented milestones based on the framework's capabilities.
- **Avoiding Overcomplication**: Incremental development with a focus on practical and feasible milestones.
- **Continuous Evolution**: Ongoing adaptation and enhancement of the codebase, models, and API integrations.
